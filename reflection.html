        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>During my time learning coding, I've learned a variety of skills, such as styling a webpage with a variety of designs and debugging any problems. Such problems were uploading my video of the contacts to the actual webpage. I found out pretty quickly that code.org does not support videos on their website only youtube links. I tried to work around it but all like it was impossible to upload it. Then I remembered something from my past coding expiriences. Github allows for users to upload a website on their page. I tried it and it allowed video files to be uploaded. With alittle help form ChatGPT to debug some of the issues like the video not sticking in the middle of the page, I was able to finish it. Then I useed my spare time to look up youtube videos to help style and make my webpage look more like the apple store. Like my the circlular mininalistic design I projected onto my website.</p>

        <p>Some things I have come to appreciate are the ability to think about an idea, such as my AR eye contacts, and be able to make it with new technologies and machinery. This process of creating something from a concept is a powerful and rewarding experience.</p>
        
        <p>Concerns may appear as too many advancements could be our demise. King Solomon in the Old Testament asked for wisdom from God; he was given it, which led to his downfall as too much wisdom made him realize how pointless everything is. Too much technological advancement could lead to machinery realizing how pointless their job is and rising against humans. Such is the concern with the rise of AI. There haven't been "set" laws of how machinery should and shouldn't act or react. They have no morals, no emotionsâ€”just a creation made by humans. So is it smart to be playing God?</p>
